# bug_reports

These are **consumer bug reports** which I and others can report as regular consumers or users of a product or service. 

I will use the Issues of this repo to add extra information when doing bug reports, such as to Google for Google Meet or Chrome bugs.

You may add your consumer bug reports to the issues section as well. If a particular existing bug report applies to you, you should "upvote" it by reacting to it with the +1 thumbs-up sign: üëç.
