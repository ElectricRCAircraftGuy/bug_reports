# bug_reports

These are **consumer bug reports** which I and others can report as regular consumers or users of a product or service. 

- Use the [Issues](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/bug_reports/issues) of this repo to add extra information when doing bug reports, such as to Google for Google Meet or Chrome bugs.
- You may add your own consumer bug reports to the issues section as well. 
- If a particular existing bug report applies to you, you should "upvote" it by reacting to it with the +1 thumbs-up sign: üëç, in order to try to get it more attention from the company whose bug it is.
